# Pokémon Website

<p><b>This is a project I worked on by myself two years ago, and it’s a page I hold dear ❤️.</b> </p> 
<p>It was one of my first experiences building a website from scratch, and I really enjoyed the process of creating and styling it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

<p>The page showcases information about different Pokémon, and I designed it to be interactive, where users can view details about their favorite Pokémon. This project holds a special place in my heart as it was a big step in my journey as a web developer, and it reminds me of how much I’ve grown since then.</p>
